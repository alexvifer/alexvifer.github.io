I am **Alejandro Vicente**, PhD student in Economics at University of Alicante.  

My research broadly focuses on **Quantitative Macroeconomics**, and more specifically on entrepreneurship, firm dynamics and education. The common thread of my research agenda is to understand how different types of frictions and educational patterns affect the allocation of resources and shape the macroeconomy.
